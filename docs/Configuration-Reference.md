## Scent System

```yaml
scent-system:
  enabled: true
  max-scent: 100.0
  sprint-add: 1.5             # scent per second while sprinting
  kill-add: 0.8               # scent per kill

  decay-interval-seconds: 4   # how often scent decays
  scent-scale: 15.0           # higher = less impact on horde size
  # jump-add: 0.5             # scent per jump (code default; add to override)
```

## Base Zombie Stats

```yaml
zombie-settings:
  health: 25.0   # base HP (20 = 10 hearts)
  damage: 6.0    # base attack damage
  speed: 0.32    # base movement speed
  allow-baby-zombies: false
  allow-zombie-villagers: true

  zombie-guts:
    enabled: true              # master switch for the immunity system
    drop:
      enabled: true            # toggle the rare death drop
      chance: 0.02             # 0.0–1.0 per eligible kill (0.02 = 2%)
      require-player-kill: true # only drop on a player's killing blow
```

See **[Zombie Guts & Immunity](Zombie-Guts-and-Immunity.md)**.

> The combust handler also reads `zombie-settings.allow-daylight-burning` (default behavior allows it for `NORMAL` zombies) — set it to control whether non-immune zombies burn in daylight.

## Spawning

  day-horde-size: 2            # smaller base size for day hordes
  day-horde-variance: 2
  use-mob-blacklist: true      # true = blacklist mode; false = whitelist mode

## Performance

```yaml
performance:
  max-total-zombies: 300       # global zombie cap per world (culls furthest over this)
  tps-threshold: 15.0          # pause new spawns below this TPS; resume once it recovers

    spawn-chance: 0.05           # per player per tick-interval (0.05 = 5%)
    spawn-tick-interval: 100     # ticks between rolls (100 = every 5 s)
