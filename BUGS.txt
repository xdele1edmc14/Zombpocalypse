Zombies Still Spawn In front of me
The "pop up" effect does not work(remove it, its unnessecary)
Zombie Spawn Rates Still Hardcoded to 50
during a blood moon, it says "Attempting to spawn horde of size: 35 near xDele1ed (Multiplier: 5.0)" but it spawns a very small horde
the 'apocalypse-settings:' dosent work. the health logic, etc works but the spawn rate, spawn radius, base horde size, spawn variance does not work.
even if i set:

spawn-rate: 1            # Ticks between spawns (20 ticks = 1 second)
  spawn-radius: 1             # Blocks around player
  base-horde-size: 100           # Base zombies per horde
  horde-variance: 100         # Random +0 to +4 zombies
  day-spawn-chance: 0.02       # 2% chance to spawn during day

only a little amount of zombies spawn. It seems the spawning logic is completly broken.
when you start a bloodmoon, then reload the plugin. a new bossbar below the previous one appears then the previous one freezes
